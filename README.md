# Flutter Application consuming Firebase

In this project I followed a [37 hours Flutter tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8&t=197s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) by freeCodeCamp.org. My main goal regarding this project to my career was learning how multi platform frameworks like Flutter and React Native work and are structured.
In this project - even when it's kinda basic - I built a multi platform Flutter app that is able to consume a Firebase db and use it's authentication in a mail and password system. 


Got to thanks both, freeCamp and Vandad Nahavandipoor for their great aport to my career and ensuring free and world wide access to learning resources.
